        The Business Card Trading Card Game was invented to incentivize swapping
        cards among friends in hobbyist communities and at conventions.
        Literally any business card (with an icon) can be added to a deck.
      </p>
      <p class="shadow">
        You only need two players with one card each to get started.

        <summary>Intent</summary>
        <p>
          In the 90s, hobby and fandom meetups would pass around VHS tapes,
          booklets, and CDs to help pass their work around within their
          respective communities. Now that everything is digital, these physical
          pieces of memorabilia rarely get passed around anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I decided to invent an easy to access method and game to share our
          social media and work among our friends at meetups and conventions in
          a fun and interesting way.

      <h1>How To Play</h1>

      <p>
        Paper Icon beats Rock Icon. Rock Icon beats Scissors Icon. Scissors Icon
        beats Paper Icon.
      </p>
      <h2>Standard Method</h2>
      <p>
        There are two players. They shuffle their decks and place them face
        down. They each draw the first card and place it face up. Winning icon
        wins the game. You can play any number of rounds. The minimum deck size
        is one.
      </p>

      <details>
        <summary>Other Play Methods</summary>

        <h2>Modified Method</h2>
        <p>
          There are two players. They shuffle their decks and them face down.
          They each draw 3 cards and place them into their hand. They play their
          chosen card from their hand face down. When both players are ready,
          they reveal their played cards. Winning icon wins the game. You can
          play any number of rounds. The minimum deck size is 3.
        </p>
        <h2>Restrictive Method</h2>
        <p>
          There are two players. They look through their decks for one card of
          each icon plus an additional card of their choice (4 cards total).
          They place these cards into their hand. Each round, they play one card
          face down until both players are ready. Then they reveal the cards at
          the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each card in their hand can only be played once. Play continues until
          they are out of cards in their hand. The winner is determined by
          either the first win or the most wins. The minimum deck size is 4.
        </p>
        <h2>Creative Method</h2>
        <p>
          You can make up your own rules. It can be Roshambo-based or based on
          something entirely different. Maybe you each have large decks, so you
          play a modified game of Go Fish for a pair of two cards with a
          specific name, letter, or theme. Perhaps you share a deck and play a
          community-specific version of Guess Who.
        </p>
        <p>The options are limitless.</p>

      <h1>Making Cards</h1>

      <details>
        <summary>Required Icons</summary>
        <p>
          In order to play the game, the business card must have 1 of 3 icons:
          Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The suggested icons are these public domain ones made by
          <a href="https://thenounproject.com/fissionstrategy/"
            >Fission Strategy</a
          >. They have been re-uploaded here in
          <a href="https://github.com/FravBox/BusinessCardTCG/tree/main/icons"
            >/icons/</a
          >
          in both PNG and SVG formats. These icons can be any orientation,
          color, or size, as long as they are immediately legible on the card.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, you can use other icons that represent the same thing, as
          long as they are easily understood.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Design</summary>
        <p>
          The cards should be the standard business card size of 3.5" x 2". In
          <a
            href="https://github.com/FravBox/BusinessCardTCG/tree/main/templates"
            >/templates/</a
          >
          you will find a very basic PSD and PNG file of the appropriate size.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your card can have literally anything on it as long as it has one of
          the 3 icons. Some sample cards have been provided for inspiration and
          starter decks in
          <a

        <summary>Printing</summary>
        <h2>Cheapest</h2>
        <p>
          The cheapest method is obviously printing the cards yourself using
          cardstock and cutting the paper yourself or buying paper specifically
          made for printing business cards at home.
        </p>
        <h2>Easiest - One Design</h2>
        <p>
          The easiest way to print one card multiple times (e.g. your own card
          for swapping) is to find literally any printing service and give them
          the image file of your card. This could take the form of an only
          service such as vistaprint, or an office store like staples.
        </p>
        <h2>Easiest - A Custom Deck (many designs)</h2>
        <p>
          Makeplayingcards.com has no minimum order and the ability to customize
          every card, front and back. You can make business card sized cards
          there.
          <a
            href="https://www.makeplayingcards.com/design/custom-business-card-deck.html"
          >
            Here is a direct link to that product page</a
          >. You can also make cool custom deck boxes there. I have printed with
          them in the past and they've made me brand loyal. (the link to them is
          not an affiliate link)
        </p>
        <p>
          MakePlayingCards.com has its own downloadable templates, an optional
          software to use to design cards, and always prints rounded corners.
          I've included their template in
          <a
            href="https://github.com/FravBox/BusinessCardTCG/tree/main/templates"
            >/templates/</a
          >. There's also some premade templates for MPC that have [MPC] in
          their name.
