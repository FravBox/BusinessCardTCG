# BusinessCardTCG
The Business Card Trading Card Game was invented to incentivize swapping cards among friends in hobbyist communities and at conventions. 

Literally any business card can be added to a deck simply. You only need two players with one card each to get started.

# Card Requirements
Cards _must_ have 1 of 3 icons on them: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

Cards _should_ be business card size (3.5" x 2" or ~51 mm x 89mm).     
Cards _should_ be one-sided.    
Cards _must_ have the icon on _only one_ side.

Other than this, cards can have literally anything on them!

You can retroactively include business cards you already own by drawing the icon on the card or printing stickers with the icons on them and placing them on the card(s) you'd like to use.

# How To Play
Paper Icon beats Rock Icon.     
Rock Icon beats Scissors Icon.    
Scissors Icon beats Paper Icon.

## Standard Method
There are two players. They shuffle their decks and place them face down. They each draw the first card and place it face up. Winning icon wins the game. You can play any number of rounds. The minimum deck size is one.

## Modified Method

There are two players. They shuffle their decks and them face down. They each draw 3 cards and place them into their hand. They play their chosen card from their hand face down. When both players are ready, they reveal their played cards. Winning icon wins the game. You can play any number of rounds. The minimum deck size is 3.

## Restrictive Method

There are two players. They look through their decks for one card of each icon plus an additional card of their choice (4 cards total). They place these cards into their hand. Each round, they play one card face down until both players are ready. Then they reveal the cards at the same time.

Each card in their hand can only be played once. Play continues until they are out of cards in their hand. The winner is determined by either the first win or the most wins. The minimum deck size is 4.

## Creative Method

You can make up your own rules. It can be ROshambo-based or based on something entirely different. Maybe you each have large decks, so you play a modified game of Go Fish for a pair of two cards with a specific name, letter, or theme. Perhaps you share a deck and play a community-specific version of Guess Who.

The options are limitless.
