# Starter Cards
These are cards people have volunteered in order for you to collect a "starter deck" and/or take ideas from on how to design your card.

**This is not an all-inclusive list of cards that exist.** Anyone, at any time, can create any card that is compatible with the game! And we hope that you will swap and trade these cards at gatherings related to your hobby and/or fandom, such as at conventions and event meetups.

## Decks
At the moment, there is only the AMV (anime music video) deck, which collects cards from AMV editors. But if you would like to have another type of deck added to this repo, feel free to start a discussion, issue, or pull request.
