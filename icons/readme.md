# Icons
In order to play the game, the business card must have 1 of 3 icons: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

The suggested icons are these public domain ones made by [Fission Strategy](https://thenounproject.com/fissionstrategy/). But you can use other icons that represent the same thing, as long as they are easily understood.

These icons can be any orientation, color, or size, as long as they are immediately legible on the card. 

# Retroactively adding icons to cards
If you already have business cards you want to use for this game, you can print the icons on small stickers and place them on the cards.
